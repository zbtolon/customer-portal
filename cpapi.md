# SoftLayer API
{: #customerportal_api}

You can use the API to interact with your account, products, and services by using direct API calls in a development environment instead of using the customer portal.
{:shortdesc}

The goal of the API is to provide an environment where you can complete any customer portal task in the API. The API environment is maintained with frequent additions and updates to ensure that you have the best options available, including the ability to program in a variety of languages and options to use SOAP, XML-RPC and REST-based APIs. Similar to working in the customer portal, if you primarily make account interactions in the API, you need a viable source for support as well.

## How do I access the API?
{: #cp_getapikey}

You can access the API with a user-specific API key. API keys are unique, alpha-numeric identifiers that allow you to securely access the API. Your API key is linked specifically to your user ID and it provides the same permissions in the API that you have in the Customer Portal. You only generate the API key once and then you can retrieve it and continue to use it. Use the following steps to generate your API key:

1. Access the customer portal using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Account** > **Users** from the navigation bar.
3. Under the **API KEY** column of the row with the user credentials, click the **Generate** link.

After the API key is generated, the **Generate** link changes to a **View** link that you can use to access your API key at any time.

## Where can I learn more about the API?
{: #cp_apimoreinfo}

The [SoftLayer Development Network (SLDN) ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://sldn.softlayer.com/){:new_window} is dedicated to supporting you when interacting with your account, products, and services by using the API. The [SLDN ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://sldn.softlayer.com/){:new_window} contains documentation on SoftLayer APIs, supported programming languages, available API calls, and more. The SLDN is the resource to use for information on various API features, a complete list of API calls, and various blog posts to give you ideas on how to best use the API.


If you have any questions about the API, you can post them in the customer forums or through direct article feedback.
